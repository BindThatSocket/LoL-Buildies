		<h1 class="title">Tristana Builds</h1>
		<p>Hi guys here are the best Tristana builds you can find.I personally recommend this one:</p>
		<p><strong>Critical Strike Full Game OP</strong></p>
		<p>Start</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Doran's Blade</li>
			<li>Health Potions</li>
			<li>Sweeper or a Trinket</li>
		</ul>
		<p>First Back</p>
		<ul>
			<li>B.F. Sword</li>
			<li>Potions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Than Get</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Infinity Edge</li>
			<li>Boots Of Speed</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other Items</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Statik Shiv</li>
			<li>Berserker's Greaves</li>
			<li>Blood Thirster</li>
			<li>Last Whisperer</li>
			<li>Phantom Dancer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Enchantments</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Boots:Aclaricy or Homeguard</li>
			<li>Sweeper Or Stealth Ward</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So Lets Explain.Starting I prefer getting a Sweeper so the support can get a Trinket,but if your support started with Sweeper because him buying Stealth wards its ok to get a Trinket.</p>
		<p>At first back I rush early B.F. Sword (normal for most ADCaries),so than my first item can be Infinity Edge.Than get Boots.</p>
		<p>The other items are pretty much self-explanatory ,but there is one thing.If the enemy team is building health get a Phantom Dancer before a Last Whisper ,so you can Crit and reduce their health easily,but if they get more armour get Last Whisperer first,so you drill through their armour.</p> 
		<p>Boots Enchantments Are self-explanatory too.Aclaricy for more speed and Home guard for more speed.A lot of people  get Ferocity ,but she has only two single target attacks.Though they are valuable ,if you iniciate with ult and than attack.</p>
		<p>This One Is A Build which focuses on having alot of AD without Criting,though I personally think that the Crit one is better.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Full AD and Lifesteal</strong></p>
		<p>Start</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Doran's Blade</li>
			<li>Health Potions</li>
			<li>Sweeper or a Trinket</li>
		</ul>
